# Chapter 2: From Idea to Tasks

## The Art of Breaking Down Ideas

One of the most crucial skills in vibe coding is transforming abstract concepts into concrete, actionable tasks. This chapter will teach you how to work with LLMs to create well-structured tickets and user stories.

## Understanding the Problem Space

### Starting with the Big Picture

Before diving into tasks, you need to understand:
- **What problem are you solving?**
- **Who are your users?**
- **What's the core value proposition?**

### The GroceryNana Example

Let's use our real example from this project:

**Original Idea**: "A software for users to create grocery lists and for local shops to see these grocery lists and send offers to users."

**Refined Understanding**: A marketplace connecting grocery buyers with local sellers, featuring:
- Private grocery lists
- Phone verification for all users
- Manual verification for sellers
- In-app messaging and negotiation
- Location-based matching

## Working with LLMs to Define Requirements

### The Question-Driven Approach

Instead of trying to specify everything upfront, use LLMs to help you explore:

```
Prompt: "I have this idea: [your idea]. What questions should I consider to make this more concrete?"
```

### Example LLM Interaction

**You**: "Help me generate tickets for a grocery list marketplace app."

**LLM**: "I'll help you create comprehensive tickets. First, let me ask some clarifying questions:
1. User experience flow: How should sellers send offers?
2. Offer system: Negotiate prices or fixed prices?
3. Geographic scope: Location-based matching?
4. Payment handling: Integrated or separate?
5. Admin verification: What information needed?
6. Data retention: How long to keep lists?"

## From Conversations to User Stories

### The User Story Format

```
As a [user type]
I want [functionality]
So that [benefit/reason]
```

### Example User Stories

**Buyer Stories**:
- As a buyer, I want to create a grocery list so that local shops can see what I need
- As a buyer, I want to set my pickup location so that only nearby shops can see my list
- As a buyer, I want to receive offers from verified sellers so that I can choose the best option

**Seller Stories**:
- As a seller, I want to see grocery lists in my area so that I can send competitive offers
- As a seller, I want to message buyers directly so that I can negotiate prices and details
- As a seller, I want to be verified by admin so that buyers trust my offers

## Creating Technical Tasks

### Breaking Down Features

Each user story typically breaks down into multiple technical tasks:

**User Story**: "As a buyer, I want to create a grocery list"

**Technical Tasks**:
1. Design grocery list data model
2. Create API endpoints for CRUD operations
3. Build frontend form for list creation
4. Implement client-side validation
5. Add backend validation and security
6. Write tests for list functionality

### Task Prioritization

Use the **MoSCoW Method**:
- **Must Have**: Core functionality
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have features
- **Won't Have**: Explicitly out of scope

## Effective Ticket Writing

### Good Ticket Structure

```markdown
## Title
Clear, action-oriented title

## Description
Brief explanation of what needs to be done

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable conditions
- [ ] Clear success metrics
- [ ] Edge cases considered

## Technical Notes
- Architecture decisions
- Dependencies
- Implementation hints

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code written and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging
```

### Example Ticket

```markdown
## User Authentication System

### Description
Implement phone number-based authentication with OTP verification for all users.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register with phone number
- [ ] OTP sent via SMS for verification
- [ ] Phone numbers are verified before account activation
- [ ] Secure session management with JWT
- [ ] Rate limiting for OTP requests

### Technical Notes
- Use Twilio for SMS delivery
- Implement JWT for session management
- Add Redis for OTP storage (5-minute expiry)
- Hash phone numbers for privacy

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Backend API endpoints created
- [ ] Frontend registration flow
- [ ] Tests written (unit + integration)
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## Working with LLMs for Task Generation

### Effective Prompts

**For Initial Breakdown**:
```
"Break down this user story into technical tasks: [story]. 
Consider backend, frontend, database, and testing requirements."
```

**For Refinement**:
```
"Review these tasks and suggest any missing items or potential issues: [task list]"
```

**For Dependencies**:
```
"What's the optimal order to implement these tasks? What dependencies exist?"
```

## Managing Complexity

### Avoiding Overwhelming Tasks

- **Single Responsibility**: Each task should do one thing well
- **Time-boxed**: Tasks should be completable in 1-4 hours
- **Testable**: Clear way to verify completion
- **Independent**: Minimal dependencies on other tasks

### When to Split Tasks

Split if the task:
- Takes more than a day to complete
- Involves multiple team members
- Has multiple acceptance criteria
- Touches multiple system components

## Iterative Refinement

### The Feedback Loop

1. **Create Initial Tasks**: Based on current understanding
2. **Start Implementation**: Begin working on highest priority items
3. **Discover Issues**: Find gaps or problems during development
4. **Refine Tasks**: Update, split, or add new tasks
5. **Repeat**: Continue until feature is complete

### Learning from Implementation

As you build, you'll discover:
- Missing edge cases
- Technical challenges
- User experience issues
- Performance considerations

Use these discoveries to refine your approach and create better tasks.

## Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Write clear, specific acceptance criteria
- ✅ Include technical context and constraints
- ✅ Consider the user's perspective
- ✅ Plan for testing and documentation
- ✅ Estimate effort and complexity

### Don'ts
- ❌ Make tasks too large or vague
- ❌ Ignore dependencies between tasks
- ❌ Forget about error handling and edge cases
- ❌ Skip documentation and testing
- ❌ Assume everything will work perfectly

## Tools and Templates

### Useful Tools
- **GitHub Issues**: For task tracking and collaboration
- **Notion/Confluence**: For requirements documentation
- **Miro/Figma**: For visual planning and user flows
- **Linear/Jira**: For agile project management

### Task Templates
Keep templates for common task types:
- API endpoint creation
- Database schema changes
- Frontend component development
- Testing implementation
- Documentation updates

## What's Next?

Now that you know how to break down ideas into tasks, you're ready to learn how to effectively work with LLMs to implement these tasks. In the next chapter, we'll explore best practices for LLM collaboration.
